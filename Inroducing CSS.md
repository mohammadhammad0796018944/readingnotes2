# Getting to Know CSS
Cascading Style Sheet or CSS is a stylesheet language that dictates how your website elements should look like. You can control the design, layout, font, and the color of your website content by embedding a CSS file into your HTML document
As you can see, the CSS syntax consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector is the HTML element that you’re about to control. Whereas the declaration block contains the property name and the value of the HTML element – both of them are separated by a colon (:) and declared within curly brackets Let’s say you want the font size of your heading one (h1) to be 20 pixels
