# JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY

# The ABC OF PROGRAMMING 

# Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript
language itself, you need to become familiar with some key
concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in
three sections:

# What is a script and how do I create one?
# How do computers fit in with the world around them?
# How do I write a script for a web page?

# WHAT IS A SCRIPT AND HOW DO I CREATE ONE 
 you could compar script to any of the following 
 # recipe 
By fo llowing the instructions in a
recipe, one-by-one in the order
set out, cooks can create a dish
they have never made before.
# HANDBOOKS
Large companies often provide
handbooks for new employees
that contain procedures to fo llow
in certain situations
# MANUALS
Mechanics often refer to car
repair manuals when servicing
models they are not familiar
with. These manuals contain a
series of tests to check the key
functions of the car are working,
along with details of how to fix
any issues that arise.

# when you start you have some steps 
DEFINE THE GOAL
DESIGN THE SCRIPT
CODE EACH STEP

# designing a script tasks 

EX 
chec each room
does room need tidying  - y tidy room -no 
does minibar need restocking - y restock - n
go to next room

  # how do computer fit in with the world around them

  # the COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA
  Here is a model of a hotel, along with some model trees, model people,
and model cars. To a human, it is clear what kind of real -world object
each one represents.

 # OBJECTS & PROPERTIES
 If you could not see the picture of the hotel and cars, the data in the
information boxes alone would still tell you a lot about this scene

# EVENTS
There are common ways in which people interact
with each type of object. For example, in a car a
driver will typically use at least two pedals. The car
has been designed to respond differently when the
driver interacts with each of the different pedals

# METHODS

# what is 
Methods typically represent how people (or other
things) interact with an object in the real world

# WHAT DOES A METHOD DO
The code for a method can contain lots of
instructions that together represent one task.
When you use a method, you do not always need to
know how it achieves its task; you just need to know
how to ask the question and how to interpret any
answers it gives you
